# Machine Learning in Medical Imaging and Biology (8DM40)

# Materials

Machine Learning Fundamentals I
* [Lecture slides]
* [Practical work](practicals/week_1.ipynb)

# Learning objectives

After completing the course, the student will be able to:
* Recognize how machine learning methods can be used to solve problems in medical imaging and computational biology.
* Comprehend the basic principles of machine learning.
* Implement and use machine learning methods.
* Design experimental setups for training and evaluation of machine learning models.
* Analyze and critically evaluate the results of experiments with machine learning models.

## Instruction

The students will receive instruction in the following ways:

* Lectures;
* Guided practical sessions;
* Contact hours with the project instructors for questions, assistance and advice;
* Online discussion (in Canvas, see below).

Course instructors:
* Mitko Veta
* Federica Eduatti 

## Recommended preliminary knowledge

8DB00 Image acquisition and Processing, and 8DC00 Medical Image Analysis.

## Software

The practical assignments for this course will be done in Python. We recommend the Anaconda Python distribution.

## Canvas

The [course page in Canvas] will be used for submission of the assignments, scheduling of the lectures and contact hours and announcements. The students are highly encouraged to use the Discussion section in Canvas. All general questions (e.g. issues with setting up the programming environment, error messages etc., general methodology questions) should be posted in the Discussion section in Canvas and not asked during the contact hours.
